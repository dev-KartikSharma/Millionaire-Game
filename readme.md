## 🧠 What is this?

**"Kaun Banega Bugpati"** is part of my **#100Days100StupidProjects** challenge – a daily commitment to building fun, wacky, and sometimes useful projects just to learn and enjoy coding again.

This one is a quiz game with:
- 🔐 A login page  
- 🎲 Randomized questions from a JSON file  
- 💡 Multiple-choice answers (radio buttons)  
- 😴 A friendly snooze warning (the app sleeps if you're inactive)

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Python** 🐍  
- **Streamlit** 💻  
- **JSON** for storing questions  
- A pinch of sarcasm and a ton of patience

---

## 🚨 Known Quirks

- The app may go to sleep due to Streamlit free-tier limits.  
  👉 Just click the **"Wake Up"** button and it’ll snap back like a clingy ex.
